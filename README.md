Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS)is an analytical technique that uses the high energy of laser pulses to identify chemical elements present in an unknown material. It usually involves focusing light energy from a laser source unto the unknown material. The laser energy forces the target sample to emit light of frequencies and wavelengths. A detector transmits these wavelengths to a spectrometer. A computer connected to spectrometer displays the intensities of the collected data as a function of wavelength.
